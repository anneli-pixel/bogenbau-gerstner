      Franziska Gerstner, born in Ulm, Germany, made her first violin at age 17 in the workshop of her father, who is a violin maker in Ulm.
      After graduating from a high school with a focus on music in Ulm she moved to England for her violin making training. At the NSVM violin making school in Newark she immersed herself in the world of violin making.

      Her first job after graduation introduced her to the bows of the string instrument family. In New York City, she had the opportunity to work in the workshop of Isaac Salchow, an esteemed bow maker and expert. During her time there she did both repairs and rehairs of old French bows.
