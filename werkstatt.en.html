    <p>Welcome to my bow making workshop. I'm based in joint premises with <span class="underline">violin maker Janine Wildhage <a href="http://www.wildhage-violins.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(www.wildhage-violins.de)</a></span> in Berlin Kreuzberg. I'm happy to offer the following:</p>

    <h2>Rehairs</h2>
    <p>After intensive practice and playing music, but also if the bow hair has been a while, it must be renewed. You will receive from me promptly a new bow cover with high quality hair for your violin, viola, cello or double bass bow.</p>

    <h2>Repairs</h2>
    <p>If something has broken on your bow, feel free to bring it in for repair. I'll take care of headplates, wraps, rod and frog repairs, replacing the pearl or leather, and much more.</p>

    <h2>Frog and Button Replicas</h2>
    <p>If the frog or button of a bow is damaged and can not be repaired, or you want to replace the originals, I will make you identical copies true to the original style.</p>

    <h2>Handmade New Bows</h2>
